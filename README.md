# Energy Flow Dashboard
This project is a Power BI dashboard designed to provide insights into energy consumption, cost efficiency, and emissions. It compares renewable and non-renewable energy usage while highlighting trends over time, by location, and by season.

---
## 📌 Project Background
Energy data from multiple locations often lacks a unified, actionable view for decision-making. This dashboard consolidates key metrics—such as energy usage, cost per kWh, and emissions—into a single, interactive report. It enables stakeholders to evaluate cost differences between renewable and non-renewable sources and to identify seasonal and regional patterns affecting overall efficiency.

---
## 📊 Dashboard Objectives

✅ Compare renewable and non-renewable energy usage and costs
✅ Analyze energy costs by location, month, and season
✅ Highlight cost differences between energy types
✅ Track total consumption and emissions
